### What I learned from the Good Developer Mindset article

##### The article emphasizes that being a great developer is about more than just writing code—it's about how you think and approach your work. It outlines 16 key mindsets, from embracing continuous learning and breaking problems down, to prioritizing simplicity, user value, and effective collaboration. Developers should aim to write maintainable, readable code, automate repetitive tasks, and plan for long-term adaptability. The most effective developers iterate quickly, focus on solving real problems, and are comfortable making trade-offs. Ultimately, it's about cultivating habits and mental models that lead to smarter decisions and better software.
